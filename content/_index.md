### Appreciating and sharing the wonder and beauty of nature one image at a time.
Welcome, I am a keen nature photographer living in wonderful New Zealand.  I have found that taking photos of nature has taught me to stop, look and then appreciate the little things that I would normally have missed.  

Below is a small sample of what you will find in the portfolio sections where you will be able to view the full resolution images.
