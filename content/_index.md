### Appreciating and sharing the wonder and beauty of nature one image at a time.
Welcome, I am a keen nature photographer living in wonderful New Zealand.  I have found that taking photos of nature has taught me to stop, look and then appreciate the little things that I would normally have missed.  

Below is a small sample of what you will find in the portfolio sections where you will be able to view the full resolution images.  Please make contact if you are interested in any of the images or even just finding out the back story to where the images were taken.
