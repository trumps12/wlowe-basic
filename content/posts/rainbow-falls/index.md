Often with land scape photography I might visit a location during the day and visualise what a pleasing composition might look like at different times of the day. For example, where would the light come from at pre-dawn, sunrise or sunset.   

One such visit was one of the first visits to the NZMCA (New Zealand Motor Caravan Association) parks in Keri Keri.
The NZMCA own and operate quite a few camps in NZ where you can stay in a self-contained vehicle for a few nights at a nominal charge. This park backs onto a walking track that leads through native bush to the Rainbow waterfall directly below the camp.  

On our first visit I stood at several locations at the base of the falls and visualised what it would be like at sunrise or sunset and what length of exposure would be good.

I decided on the location and an exposure of several minutes and a time of just after sunrise as the light started to illuminate the scene over the tops of the native trees. 
Often the resulting image does not look like or evoke the feeling that I had envisaged in the planning.

On the second visit to the NZMCA park in Keri Keri I set up the tripod at sunrise.  Took a few test shots to see the effect of varying exposure lengths.
The image to the right is the result and one of the few times the resulting image accurately matches my vision during the planning.  

Each time I look at this image it generates the same feeling I had while I stood the at the bottom of the water falls just after sunrise.  The viewing platform can be seen just to the right of the top of the falls.  Our campervan is about ten meters through the bush from this platform.  So we could hear the rushing water from the campervan.
