Welcome, I am a photographer living in wonderful New Zealand.  I have a passion for sharing the wonders of the natural world one image at a time.
Please have a look at my portfolios. I currently focus on having the bird images printed onto alluminium panels using dye sublimation which makes them ideal as garden art.    

I have many more images uploaded to the various print on demand websites that I use and a subset are also available on Adobe Stock. The full range of images available via print on demand sites can be found at:

https://pixels.com/profiles/dva-photo-nz or at https://www.redbubble.com/people/DVart-nz/.  

Having recently purchased a campervan I am now travelling and re-discovering how wonderful New Zealand is.  

I will also post the occasional blog of our local travels when these travels result in memorable images.

I can be found on: <br>

Please do not hesitate to make contact if you are interested in any of the images on this site or any of the print on demand websites I use.
